# Please follow these given guidelines in developing your CRUD application
**Note**: Through out the document `I` means `developers Team`
* Each one is assigned a folder and I expect you to mess up your own folder
* Don't push your application in single commit (This is not a coding test. I expect step by step progress being committed. This is starter for our delicious meal so don't hurry make sure *you know what you are developing*)
* Each folder has a `readme` file. Adjust yours according to given template
* Just don't copy some random stuff online in order to complete your application. Take some time understand it and try to rewrite.
* Try to document your code from intial stages (Helps a lot in main application)

**Template**
*I expect below details as minimum requirement. Please add up as per your requirements*
* **Description:** Short note on what you made
* **Documentation:** Status (How much done and what needs to be done)
* **Features:** Explain features/components of your application (Try to be short and crisp)
* **Short demo video:** Once everything is done make a small video explaining your application (Not more than 100 seconds. Make this in the end.) 
* **Deployemnt:** Deployments status of your application (Optional)
