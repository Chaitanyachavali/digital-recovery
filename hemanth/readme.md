# OUR PROJECT IS DIVIDED INTO 3 PARTS. 
## Now the Part-1 consists of 
- Using code reuseability to the best of our ability not only in Part-1 but through out the project
- Selecting a UI for the project and collecting all the components required to complete Part-1
- Have a review of all the tables and the Data displayed in it.
- I will provide the Tables Data to you below.
- Main Task in this Part-1 is Reading,Display and Selecting required coloumns to display as Table, time taken for it.
- Creating a MongoDB Schema for Tables.
- In the tables the Upadation and Deletion can be done by Two types either by User or App
- The Updation through App will be discussed later
- The user should be able to update and that will be saved to database and changes in other tables are also done if required.

## The flow of Part-1 will be Excel Sheet --> Read -->Selecting the Coloumns -->Displaying the Required fields in the Table along with Data --> Data persent in this Table will also show in in other tables if the coloumn name matches --> User Updation and Saving in the Database.
